        IAB AD Container Meta-Data Attributes

            This specification allows publishers to define meta-data attributes on ad container tags, so that ad contents can determine
            the property.  Ad contents cannot easily understand their environment withough such information as reading style/CSS information
            does not provied concrete info.

            HTML allows for custom meta-data attributes to be placed on any HTML tag.  The HTML5 specification requires that such attribute names
            be prefixed with "data-".

            Therefore we define an overall prefix of "data-iab-" to indicate higher order IAB standards information.

            We also define an overall prefix of "data-iabc-" to indicate attributes relavent to ad container rendering information ,
            which also require the attribute "data-iab-container" to be present in the given tag (see below).


            data-iab-container  ==> This element is an ad container that conforms to IAB specifications and provides further attributes / meta-data for how the container
                                    is setup.  The value for the attribute determines the overall "type" of the ad container.  Further meta-data attributes about
                                    the overall configuration of the container tag should use the prefix "data-iabc-"

                                    Valid values are as follows:

                                    -- "flex" indicates that the container is setup to automatically scale/resize with a change in the window or screen size.

                                    -- "sf-flex" indicates a SafeFrame will be inserted between the publisher and the ad content, which will also be configured
                                        to be flexible.

                                    -- "fixed" indicates the container is a fixed size.

                                    -- "sf-fixed" indicates a SafeFrame will be inserted between the publisher and the ad content, which will be of a fixed size.

                                    -- Note that for both of the SafeFrame types, the ad content also has a JavaScript API that it can communicate with to determine
                                       the SafeFrame configuration / type.

            data-iabc-aspect ==> Indicates the aspect ratio to be used for a flexible container.  MUST be present if data-iabc-type="flex" is set.  Aspect ratio string values
                                 are formatted as [width]x[height].

            data-iabc-minw  ==> Indicates the minimum width (in pixels) that the ad container will size to when it's defined as flexible. Note that there is no need for a minimum
                                height requirement since that is naturally computed by the combination of the aspect ratio and minimum width.

            data-iabc-w     ==> The default/initial width (in pixels) of the container.  Normally used for fixed sizes but can also be used for flexible containers as the
                                starting point or fallback value.

            data-iabc-h     ==> The default/inital height (in pixels) of the container.  Normally used for fixed sizes but can also be used for flexible containers as the
                                starting point or fallback value.

            data-iabc-maxw  ==> Indicates the maximum width (in pixels) that the ad container will size to when it's defined as flexible, or the maximum width that a fixed
                                container can expand to temporarily (such as in rich-media cases).

            data-iabc-maxh  ==> Indicates the maximum height (in pixels) that the ad container will size to when it's defined as flexible, or the maximum height that a fixed
                                container can expand to temporarily (such as in rich-media cases).


            In addition, we show an example here of what happens when an ad container is flexible.  The general use-case is that publishers should mark their
            containers with the above meta-data attributes as noted.  In turn this will translate into specific HTML and CSS settings.  In terms of making ad container
            tags automatically flexible, the easiest way to do this is known as the "padding" technique.  The tag has a width of 100%, and then has it's padding-top CSS
            property also set to a percentage.  The percentage value for padding-top, is calculated via the aspect ratio provied in the data-iabc-aspect attribute.

            The algorithm for this is as follows:

                1.) Given an aspect ratio value, formatted as [width]x[height]
                    a.) Convert the [width] part of the string into a base 10 integer
                    b.) Convert the [height] part of the string into a base 10 integer

                2.) Divide the [height] integer by the [width] integer from step 1. (so "16x9" becomes 9 / 16 == .5625)

                3.) Multiply the resultant value by 100.

                4.) On the given container HTML tag do the following:

                    a.) Set the CSS width to 100%;
                    b.) Set the CSS height to auto;
                    c.) Set the CSS padding-top to the value from step 3 plus the "%" sign. (so .5625 from step 2 becomes 56.25%).
                    d.) Set the CSS margin-top to the inverse value from step 3 plus the "%" sign. (so .5625 from step 2 becomes 56.25%, and so the margin-top is -56.25%

            HTML tags further inside the given ad-container tag that is defined by the publisher, can then simply set their overall
            bounding box to have a CSS width and CSS height set to values of 100%, and that box will automatically resize as needed.

            CSS styles to make a container tag flexible.
